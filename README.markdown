Open in Espresso
================

Application used to load files and folders into Espresso from within Finder.

Usage
-----

Clicking the toolbar icon opens the selected file or files if there is a selection; otherwise it opens the current directory in Espresso. You can also drag-and-drop files to the icon to open those.

Installation
------------

Download OpenInTextMate.zip, extract the file somewhere (I keep it in /Applications/Scripts), then drag it onto the Finder toolbar. You'll need to wiggle it a bit for the toolbar to catch on.
